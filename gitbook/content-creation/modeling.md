# Modeling and Animation

## Blockbench
[Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net/) is the official supported modeling tool for Hytale. It is free, open-source, and widely used in the voxel community.

### Getting Started
1. **Download Blockbench**: Get the latest version from the official website.
2. **Hytale Plugin**: Install the generic model format or specific Hytale plugins if available (Hytale models often share similarities with Bedrock/Java format concepts but have unique properties).
3. **Exporting**: Models are typically exported in standard formats or specific Hytale formats which are then placed in your pack's `Common/Models/` directory.

## Block Animations
Animations can be added to blocks to bring them to life.
- **File Format**: `.blockyanim`
- **Location**: `Common/Animations/`

Animations are defined in JSON and can trigger on specific block states (e.g., "opening" a chest).
